Universal access to electricity remains a cornerstone of sustainable development, yet persistent gaps in monitoring and addressing disparities hinder progress. Over the past three decades, the lack of spatial-temporal consistent datasets has obscured nuanced trends in electrification, particularly in underserved regions. We introduce a framework integrating harmonized nighttime light observations with high-resolution population data to generate a globally consistent Electricity Access Indicator dataset. Our analysis reveals that while the unelectrified population has declined worldwide, regional disparities have intensified. High-income countries now exhibit near-saturation of electricity access, whereas many low-income regions—particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia—continue to experience substantial access deficits. Bridging this gap by 2030 requires a 37.5-fold increase in the current growth rate for lagging regions. This study offers a 31-year (1992–2022) comprehensive benchmark for assessing global electricity access through a multidimensional perspective, providing essential insights for designing equitable and effective energy policies.
